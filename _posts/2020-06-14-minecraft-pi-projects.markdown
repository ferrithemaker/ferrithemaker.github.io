I started a new repo with educative Python scripts for kids. Play and learn with Python!

The scripts are:

### picameraintominecraft.py [Level:HARD]

With this script you can render an image (from a local file or captured from picamera live picture) to a minecraft world.

### diamondswithflowerspath.py [Level: VERY EASY]

A path of diamonds and yellow flowers follows you. Try to jump!

### buildyourhouse.py [Level: MEDIUM]

Create a house inside Minecraft Pi world using nested loops.

### elevator.py [Level: MEDIUM]

Build an automatic elevator.

### deathblast.py [Level: EASY] 

Learn how to manage events to throw a vaporizer blast arround you when the player presses the mouse right button.
