You can download the new [Lifebox information Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.lifeboxinformation) from Google Play Store.

This App is not the lifebox simulator itself, but only a informative aplication to help the audiencie understand how it works when experimenting with the installation on a live event.
