I started a new repo with educative Python scripts for kids. Play and learn with Python!

The first two scripts are:

##### picameraintominecraft.py [Level:HARD]

With this script you can render an image (from a local file or captured from picamera live picture) to a minecraft world.

##### diamondswithflowerspath.py [Level: VERY EASY]

A path of diamonds and yellow flowers follows you. Try to jump!
