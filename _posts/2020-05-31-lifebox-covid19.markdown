May 23 2020 Lifebox project was invited to participate at [Covid-19 Virtually MakerFaire](https://makerfaire.com/virtually-maker-faire-2020/meet-the-makers/)

Although this project was created before the covid-19 pandemic, I adapted the narrative to explain some "virus related" general characteristics, like the expansion rate, the isolation of the groups or the "herd immunity" effect.
